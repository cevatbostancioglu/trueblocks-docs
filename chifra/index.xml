They allow you to produce and analyze transactional histories for a given Ethereum address.
You may also name addresses; grab the ABI file for a given address; add, delete, and remove monitors, and, most importantly, export transactional histories to various formats, This includes re-directing output to remote or local databases.
chifra list chifra list takes one or more addresses, queries the index of appearances, and builds TrueBlocks monitors.</description></item><item><title>Using chifra</title><link>/chifra/introduction/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/chifra/introduction/</guid><description>Similar to git, TrueBlocks has an overarching command called chifra that gives you access to all of the other subcommands.
Type:
chifra You will see a long list of commands similar to this
Usage: chifra command Purpose: Access to all TrueBlocks tools (chifra &amp;lt;cmd&amp;gt; --help for more). Where: Accounts: list list every appearance of an address anywhere on the chain export export full detail of transactions for one or more addresses monitors add, remove, clean, and list address monitors names query addresses or names of well known accounts abis fetches the ABI for a smart contract Chain Data: blocks retrieve one or more blocks from the chain or local cache transactions retrieve one or more transactions from the chain or local cache receipts retrieve receipts for the given transaction(s) logs retrieve logs for the given transaction(s) traces retrieve traces for the given transaction(s) when find block(s) based on date, blockNum, timestamp, or 'special' Chain State: state retrieve account balance(s) for one or more addresses at given block(s) tokens retrieve token balance(s) for one or more addresses at given block(s) Admin: config report on and edit the configuration of the TrueBlocks system daemon initalize and control long-running processes such as the API and the scrapers scrape scan the chain and update the TrueBlocks index of appearances chunks manage, investigate, and display the Unchained Index init initialize the TrueBlocks system by downloading from IPFS Other: explore open a local or remote explorer for one or more addresses, blocks, or transactions slurp fetch data from EtherScan for any address You may get more help on any command by typing chifra &amp;lt;cmd&amp;gt; --help.</description></item><item><title>Tutorials</title><link>/chifra/using/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/chifra/using/</guid><description>A few more examples in more detail.
Getting Help Every chifra sub-command comes with an associated help page. To get help for chifra itself, simply type
chifra A long list of commands should show. (If you have trouble, see the Installation page.)
To get help for a specific command, type
chifra &amp;lt;cmd&amp;gt; --help To get more detailed help, type
chifra &amp;lt;cmd&amp;gt; --help --verbose 2 Getting System Status The chifra command gives you access to all of TrueBlocks&amp;rsquo; functionality.</description></item><item><title>Chain data</title><link>/chifra/chaindata/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/chifra/chaindata/</guid><description>The TrueBlocks tools extract raw blockchain data directly from the node. You may extract block data, transactional data, receipts, logs, and traces. Each tool has it own set of options, allowing you to get exactly the data that you want.
chifra blocks The chifra blocks tool retrieves block data from your Ethereum node or, if previously cached, from the TrueBlocks cache. You may specify multiple blocks per invocation.
By default, chifra blocks queries the full transactional details of the block (including receipts).</description></item><item><title>Chain state</title><link>/chifra/chainstate/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/chifra/chainstate/</guid><description>The two tools in this group deal with the Chain State. As chain state data concerns balances and byte code. it is distinct from Chain Data, which concerns things like blocks, transactions, or traces.
The two tools are chifra state and chifra tokens. The first allows you to query account balances, the byte code of a smart contract (if available), the nonce, and other information about an address. The second tool, chifra tokens, deals with ERC20 and ERC721 token balances and other data.</description></item><item><title>Admin</title><link>/chifra/admin/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/chifra/admin/</guid><description>The Admin component allows you to query the status of the TrueBlocks system. You can query the status; query for information about TrueBlocks caches; control the creation, sharing, and pinning of the TrueBlocks index of appearances; and even serve the data through an API.
See the API documentation for all information about using the API.
chifra config The chifra config program allows you to manage the various TrueBlocks caches. You may list all of the caches, some of the cache, or even individual caches either in terse or full detail.</description></item><item><title>Other</title><link>/chifra/other/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/chifra/other/</guid><description>These commands call some useful miscellaneous tools:
chifra explore a quick way to open a blockchain explorer, ethslurp an older tool that lets you call data from EtherScan. (This has issues of centralization and data quality, see explanation in its section). Note: some of these tools, like ethslurp, require an EtherScan key. Follow these instructions to add a key to your config.
chifra explore chifra explore opens Etherscan (and other explorers &amp;ndash; including our own) to the block identifier, transaction identifier, or address you specify.</description></item><item><title>Configurations</title><link>/chifra/configs/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/chifra/configs/</guid><description>Many of the chifra commands allow you to customize their behaviour through configuration files and/or environment variables. These options are documented here.
Environment Variables Each command-line option may be overridden by exporting an environment variable in your shell prior to running a chifra command.
The name of those environment variables is as follows:
The environment variable is ALL_UPPER_CASE The environment variable name preserves underbars in the item_name The name of the variable starts with the group the item belongs to For example: GROUP_ITEM_NAME.</description></item></channel></rss>
