Error message: current file does not sequentially follow previous file When using chifra scrape indexer you may get the above message. What this means is a completely empty block was returned from the RPC. When I say completely empty, this means there&amp;rsquo;s not even a miner address. Our scraper thinks that every block must contain at least one address, but on some chains this is not true (for example, on some private chains).</description></item><item><title>forEveryChain</title><link>/blog/foreverychain/</link><pubDate>Tue, 15 Feb 2022 10:45:28 -0400</pubDate><guid>/blog/foreverychain/</guid><description>Have you ever had the desire to look at every trace of every transaction of every block on every blockchain? Yes? Well, pull up a chair and visit with us for a while.
It’s a Multi-Chain World I’m sure many of you are aware of the coming &amp;ldquo;multi-chain&amp;rdquo; universe of blockchains. You know the one. The one where all sorts of little baby communities of people are going to be doing all sorts of little baby community-like things.</description></item><item><title>Installing Erigon and TrueBlocks as Services on Ubuntu</title><link>/blog/installing-erigon-and-trueblocks-as-services-on-ubuntu/</link><pubDate>Thu, 23 Dec 2021 18:10:28 -0400</pubDate><guid>/blog/installing-erigon-and-trueblocks-as-services-on-ubuntu/</guid><description>One of our users (Magnus Hansson) has written an excellent article on how to install all three of Erigon, Erigon&amp;rsquo;s RPC, and TrueBlocks as serives on Ubuntu.

Not only that &amp;ndash; the blog post is visually wonderful as well.
Thanks Magnus. Looking for some amazing data science from this quarter. Cheers.</description></item><item><title>Other articles published in 2021</title><link>/blog/other-articles-published-in-2021/</link><pubDate>Thu, 23 Dec 2021 18:10:28 -0400</pubDate><guid>/blog/other-articles-published-in-2021/</guid><description>Here&amp;rsquo;s links to a few other articles we published in 2021 on Medium.

This is short recipe to accomplish just that.
Preliminaries The first thing to understand is that the TrueBlocks core runs against a local configuration file stored in your $HOME folder called $HOME/.local/share/TrueBlocks/trueBlocks.toml. It&amp;rsquo;s an almost ridiculously simple file.
The file gets created and populated with default values the first time you build TrueBlocks.</description></item><item><title>Recipe: Getting Erc20 Transfer Events</title><link>/blog/recipe-getting-erc20-transfer-events/</link><pubDate>Tue, 13 Apr 2021 08:00:02 -0400</pubDate><guid>/blog/recipe-getting-erc20-transfer-events/</guid><description>A TrueBlocks recipe to show every ERC20 Transfer event from a given smart contract.
Note: The following assumes you have a copy of (either by having built it yourself or downloaded it) the TrueBlocks Appearance Index. These instructions also assume that the address you&amp;rsquo;re querying is an ERC 20 smart contract.
Preliminaries To get started, we want to extract (from the TrueBlocks index) a list of every transaction that our address has ever appeared in.</description></item><item><title>A Long Winded Explanation of TrueBlocks</title><link>/blog/a-long-winded-explanation-of-trueblocks/</link><pubDate>Mon, 05 Apr 2021 19:21:58 -0300</pubDate><guid>/blog/a-long-winded-explanation-of-trueblocks/</guid><description>Recently, I was engaged in a tweetstorm with Nick Johnson, for whom I have deep, deep respect. The storm was about the topic of indexing the Ethereum blockchain. As is usually the case with my tweetstorms, I don&amp;rsquo;t think I explained myself well during the thunder and lightning, so I thought I&amp;rsquo;d take a moment during the lull to better explain myself. So this is an explanation for Nick (and anyone else who&amp;rsquo;s listening) about how TrueBlocks indexes the Ethereum blockchain.</description></item></channel></rss>
