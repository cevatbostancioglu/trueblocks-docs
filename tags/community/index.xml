Thanks Leo!
For the fellow newbies, I took notes when starting this journey. I wrote a couple of posts I hope are helpful if you are setting up your own node with TrueBlocks.
Please note I focus on doing analytics. Storing and accessing the data are the most important factors for me. Thanks to everybody for the patience and helping me with all the issues!</description></item><item><title>User contribution: Simple Blockchain Indexing with TrueBlocks</title><link>https://trueblocks.io/blog/user-contribution-simple-blockchain-indexing-with-trueblocks/</link><pubDate>Wed, 07 Sep 2022 18:10:28 -0400</pubDate><guid>https://trueblocks.io/blog/user-contribution-simple-blockchain-indexing-with-trueblocks/</guid><description>&lt;p>An &lt;a href="https://dspyt.com/blockchain-data-indexer-with-trueblocks">article about TrueBlocks&lt;/a> and how our indexers work.
